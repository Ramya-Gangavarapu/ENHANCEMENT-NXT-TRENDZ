# Nxt Trendz Online Shopping Application
## Overview
Nxt Trendz is a frontend application for an online shopping platform, akin to Amazon, developed using React. This project was designed to solidify my understanding and application of key web development concepts such as authentication, state management, context, page navigation, responsive design, and clean code principles.

## Features

## User Authentication: 
Implemented a basic authentication flow with error handling for invalid credentials. Used cookies to persist user sessions across page reloads.
## Product Search and Filters: 
Allows users to search, sort, and filter products.
## Shopping Cart: 
Users can select products and add them to the shopping cart, with state management handled via React Context API.
## Protected Routes: 
Implemented role-based access control for different routes using React Router.
## Mock APIs: 
Integrated mock APIs to display product data.
## Responsive Design: 
Ensured the application is mobile-friendly using media queries and flexbox.

## Learning Objectives

Apply authentication mechanisms and handle common errors.
Utilize state management techniques using React Context API.
Implement page navigation and protected routes with React Router.
Follow clean code guidelines with consistent folder structures and naming conventions.
Create reusable components to enhance code maintainability.
Ensure responsive design for various device sizes.

## Clean Code Practices
Consistent Folder Structure: Organized files and components logically.
Meaningful Naming Conventions: Prefixed event handlers with "on" and used descriptive names for components and functions.
Reusable Components: Developed reusable UI components to minimize code duplication and enhance maintainability.

## Future Enhancements
I plan to develop a backend using Node.js and Express.js to replace the mock API implementation. This backend will provide:
More control over data management.
